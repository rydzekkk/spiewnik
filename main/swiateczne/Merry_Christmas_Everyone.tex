\begin{text}
    \textit{Intro}\\
	\\
    Snow is falling, all around me,\\
    Children playing, having fun.\\
	It's the season for love and understanding,\\
	Merry christmas everyone.
	
	Time for parties and celebration,\\
	People dancing all night long,\\
	Time for presents and exchanging kisses,\\
	Time for singing christmas songs.
	
	We're gonna have a party tonight,\\
	I'm gonna find that girl underneath the misteltoe,\\
	We'll kiss by candlelight.
	
	Room is swaying, records playing,\\
	All the old songs, we love to hear,\\
	All I wish that everyday was christmas,\\
	What a nice way to spend the year.
	
	We're gonna have a party tonight,\\
	I'm gonna find that girl underneath the mistletoe,\\
	We'll kiss by candlelight.
